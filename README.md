This is meant to be a boilerplate for new Python projects.

11-27-2023: This is far done and needs many improvements.

## Get Started
1. Create a virtual environment

        python -m venv venv

2. Install requirements in `requirements.txt`

## Building
Run below to create build folder. This will also allow you to use the script within the virtual environment.

    pip install .


It may be useful to have a Makefile.
